# A Crow's Commute
## author:

## description:
I am planning on making a simple game inspired by the way that crows often commute during the day to find food and then group up as a giant flock to keep warm at night. During the winter months I often see crows flying into town in the evening and see them huddling up in trees and on local buildings for the night. During the day though they are either by themselves or in smaller groups throughout the city, so in a way they commute just like humans do although not to a 9-5 job like you or me. My goal for this game is to accomplish a few basic features like the ability to display a 2D crow and to give it the ability to move around a 2D city via inputs from the player. To keep things simple the objectives of this game will just be to find a certain amount of food and to return to the flock before the timer expires signifying the end of the day. There may be smaller objectives like avoiding building along the flight path, but these will be added if I have enough time to achieve all the other goals first.
